## üìù Certificate Extraction Guidelines

When extracting certificate information, the app uses GPT to parse titles and organizations from event text. If an organization is hosting the event, its name should **not** be placed in the Title block for certificates associated with the host. Only include "Title of Organization" when an individual or group from that organization is being recognized by the host organization.

## ‚ú® Global Comments

The **Global Comments** box can modify any certificate field. For example:

- `Organization name for all certificates is "Acme Corp"` will set the organization on every certificate to "Acme Corp".
- `Use organization instead of title` copies the organization value into the Title field for each certificate.
- `Replace 'Officer' in title with organization` swaps the word "Officer" in every title with the certificate's organization.

After entering a global comment, click **Regenerate All Certificates** to apply the changes.

## üè∑Ô∏è Uniform Commendation

When a request includes many certificates of the same type, you can apply a single commendation to every certificate in that category. After uploading your request and extracting the entries, the app displays a **Uniform Commendation by Category** section. Enter or paste the commendation text for each category and click **Apply Uniform Commendations**. The text will replace the generated commendation for all certificates in that category.
